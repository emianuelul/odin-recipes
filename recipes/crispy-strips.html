    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons water</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders</li>
      <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Mix eggs and water
        together in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place some chicken strips in the flour mixture to coat, then gently
        shake to remove any excess flour. Coat strips in egg. Return to the
        flour mixture and coat again; repeat with egg mixture. Coat once more in
        the flour mixture, placing strips on a plate while you continue with
        remaining chicken.
      </li>
      <li>Let strips sit for 5 minutes to allow flour to set.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C); oil is ready if you drop some water in and it sizzles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches if needed, place strips in the hot oil. Cook for 8
        minutes. Turn over and continue to cook until golden brown, no longer
        pink in the centers, and juices run clear, about 8 minutes more. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Place strips on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess grease.</li>
    </ol>
